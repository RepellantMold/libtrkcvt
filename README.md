[![standard-readme compliant](https://img.shields.io/badge/standard--readme-OK-green.svg?style=plastic)](https://github.com/RichardLitt/standard-readme)

A command line tool to downgrade (that being a **very heavy keyword**) Scream Tracker 3 modules to Scream Tracker 2 modules, written in ANSI C.

## Compiling

This uses the CMake build system, but it should not be too difficult to compile yourself.
This repo uses one submodule, so make sure to run `git submodule update --init` before you attempt to compile!

## Usage

```sh
screamverter [options] -i<inputfile> -o<outputfile>

# Options:
#   -h, --help       Print this help and exit
#   -v, --verbose    Enable extremely verbose output
#   -s, --sanitize   Sanitize sample names during conversion, useful for saving them on DOS
#   -m, --memory     Handle effects calling effect memory (helps with Scream Tracker 2.24 and below)
#   -2, --stm        Convert the S3M to STM (default)
#   -x, --stx        Convert the S3M to STX (unfinished)
#   -i, --input      Input file
#   -o, --output     Output file
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> These points are important for a decent conversion.
>
> - 4 channels preferably (it only converts the first four channels.)
> - Sample sizes cannot exceed 65535 (and samples cannot be in 16-bit format.)
> - No panning (Scream Tracker 2/Scream Tracker Music Interface Kit is mono) or Adlib.
> - Sample names are gonna truncated heavily to 12 characters if its file name field is blank.
> - You can only use effects A - J, with some caveats with the table shown below.

> | Effect | Function in ST2/STMIK - in ST3/others | Notes/Quirks (Effect memory **does not exist** in Scream Tracker 2, so a parameter of 0 will act like a no-op for any effect that normally has it. (e.g. volume slide, portamento slides, vibrato, etc.)) |
> |---:|:---:|---|
> | Axx | Set speed - Set ticks per row | It has a scaling factor (TODO: handle it) alongside setting ticks per row. |
> | Bxx | Set next order - Position jump | It does not perform an immediate pattern break unlike most other trackers, so it's best to place it alongside a Pattern break. |
> | Cxx | Pattern break | The parameter is ignored which is identical behavior to NoiseTracker. |
> | Dxy | Volume slide | There's no fine slides, and y will take priority if both x and y are specified (which is backwards from how it's usually handled). |
> | Exx | Portamento down | This effect can cause the note period to underflow, and there are no fine/extra-fine slides. |
> | Fxx | Portamento up | This effect can cause the note period to overflow, ditto for fine/extra-fine slides. |
> | Gxx | Tone portamento | It does not reset the sample volume unlike most other trackers. |
> | Hxy | Vibrato | The depth is doubled compared to other trackers, this converter will attempt to adjust the depth accordingly. |
> | Ixy | Tremor | A parameter of 0 will be a very fast tremor, like old Scream Tracker 3. |
> | Jxy | Arpeggio | The effect behaves strangely since it tends to skip to y halfway through a row if x was 0, it's not commonly implemented this way however. |
> | Kxx | (No-op) | This can be entered into the editor but it does not do anything, **it also bugs out Scream Tracker 3 when importing so it's best to not use it!** |
> | Lxx | (No-op) | Ditto. |
> | Mxx | (No-op) | Ditto. |
> | Nxx | (No-op) | Ditto. |
> | Oxx | (No-op) | Ditto. |
